## Playground for prime and non-prime numbers

This small project aims to graphically represent prime numbers within a set of numbers. The basic idea behind this project is to classify all numbers in a binary tree **graph** in order to visualize the appearance of prime numbers.

A sober **map-style** UI is used to render the graph that you can **zoom** and **pan**, either with your mouse or with UI controls.

### Usage :
```console
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Test :
```console
npm run test
```

### For example :

You can display a graph showing edges and nodes that differentiates primes and non-primes.

![Small sample graph showing all edges and all nodes](Assets/SmallSampleAll.png)

And you can change the graph root type and choose to only show prime nodes.

![Small sample graph showing all edges but only primes nodes](Assets/SmallSampleEdgesAndPrimesOnly.png)

Or maybe you only want to mask prime nodes and edges?

Or only show prime edges on a large sample?
